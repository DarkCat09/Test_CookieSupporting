# Cookie Supporting Test
PHP-script for testing browser on supporting cookies.

 - ``` check_cookie.php ``` is a main script.
 - ``` checkcookie_page.html ``` is a sample page for testing cookie supporting.
 - ``` checkcookie_js.html ``` is a page with included JavaScript for testing cookie supporting.
 
**Recommended using JS-variant, instead of PHP!**
